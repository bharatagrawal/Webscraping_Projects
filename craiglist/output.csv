We are an expediting company looking to work with a few expeditors on a freelance basis. Must have at least a Class 1 Filing Representative license from the DOB. ,

Most of the work we do is done online. So, we are looking to partner with a few expeditors to file work under their license. We will work closely with you on each project to make sure you know exactly what is being filed. Our office would set up the jobs/paperwork and submit. Only filing plumbing jobs in the DOB NOW: Build system would be done by the freelancers we work with. In addition, sometimes we need to go to the borough offices (mostly Manhattan and Brooklyn) to submit something in person. If you aren't able to submit things in person once in awhile - that's OK. We can still work with you.,

- Alt-2 renovation filings,
- Pulling initial/renewal permits,
- Signing off jobs,
